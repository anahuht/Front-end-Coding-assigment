 Coding assigment for Liana Technologies. 

This year I rewrote the coding assigment with fresh view and new skills. 
The biggest problem of last year was responsivness, which I fixed now mainly using flexbox. 
To project was added parallax for main picture, and animated numbers now are powered by JavaScript on mouse over. Unfortunatelly, in mobile version numbers are loading only on tap.
